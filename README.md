# Problem Statement 
Kitchen accidents such as gas leaks, fire, and overheating often go undetected until they become dangerous. Existing safety systems are limited and unreliable due to lack of real time monitoring and verification. This project aims to develop a low-cost multimodal safety system that detects hazards early and provides instant alerts with visual confirmation.

# Objectives  
-Detect hazardous kitchen conditions (gas leaks, fire, high temperature, motion)  
-Provide real-time alerts using voice module and display/LED  
-Enable visual verification using ESP32-CAM  
-Reduce false alarms through sensor fusion  
-Demonstrate intelligent embedded safety monitoring
