The Multimodal Assistant for Kitchen Safety is designed to improve safety in domestic and commercial kitchens by continuously monitoring hazardous conditions. The system detects situations such as gas leakage, fire, excessive temperature, and unsafe operating conditions using multiple sensing and monitoring methods. By combining different modes of detection and intelligent processing, the system helps in preventing accidents and minimizing risks. It provides timely alerts and supports safer kitchen environments. This project aims to enhance reliability, reduce human error, and promote proactive safety management.
